# ImgPointIndicator
    ImagePointIndicator is a outil on which we can generate coordinates of polygons we drew on an image 

## Features
* Draw a polygon in 2 different mode: [Drag mode](#drag-mode) & [Point mode](#point-mode-precision-mode)
* Add label to identify drawn polygon
* Import image 
* Export / Import date file which contains coordinates of polygons
* Remove the last polygon
* Change the format of print in text area (transform data already printed)
* Copy data in the text area to clipboard
* Zoom the image for better precision

### Drag mode
We can draw simple rectangle or square by dragging from the first point and drop at the last point.

### Point mode (Precision mode)
In this mode we can draw a real polygon point by point to get the best and the most precise polygon.
